## My homework for the C# Professional course, less-11_pro_Thread_1
1. Using blocking constructs, create a method that will be in the for loop (say, at 10
    iterations) increment the counter by one and display the counter and the current thread.
    The method is run in three threads. Each thread must be executed in turn, i.e. in
    As a result, numbers (counter values) from 1 to 30 should be displayed on the screen in order, and not in
    random order.
2. Create a console application that in different threads can access 2
    files. Read the contents of these files and try to write the resulting
    information to the third file. Reading / writing must be carried out simultaneously in each
    from child threads. Use thread blocking to achieve correct
    writing to the final file.
